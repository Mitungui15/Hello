    <p>Welcome to Tell Me! This is a tutories application to help you know your child's curriculum. This app is all about your child. If they're in kindergarden-Fith grade this app is for you. Some times you might ask,"What did you do in school today?" all they say is"stuff". As an expirienced person in this department, I can tell you that kids really do say that. Now you can see what your child does in school.  </p>
